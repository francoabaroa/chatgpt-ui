            INCURATOR BRANDSCRIPT


            Session 1: SB1 - A Character

            Based on the transcript for Session 1, here's a summary and analysis of the key points discussed regarding INCURATOR's character/customer:


            1. Summary of key points:


            - The character is someone who feels they've fallen through the cracks in the music industry

            - They have a burning desire or "fire" to succeed in music, even if they lack talent

            - They may have faced rejection or failure but still persist

            - They could be new artists or those who had some success but fell back

            - The character feels lost, in despair, and that no one has given them a chance

            - They have a strong emotional connection to music, but no clear goals

            - They may lack resources or connections in the industry

            - They should get honest feedback[a][b],

            - They would welcome guidance and a supportive community


            2. Points with greatest alignment in the team:


            - The importance of "fire" or passion in the character

            - The character feeling overlooked or rejected by the mainstream music industry

            - The need for a supportive community or "home" for these artists

            - The desire for honest feedback and guidance


            3. Points with least alignment:


            - How to include or focus on artists with resources but no "fire" (what is the criteria?)

            - The exact definition of success for the character (major stardom vs. fulfilling career)


            4. Proposed character statement for INCURATOR Brand Script:


            INCURATOR's character is the passionate, persistent artist who feels overlooked by the mainstream music industry. Despite facing perceived rejection, silence and setbacks, they have an irrepressible desire to share their music and build a meaningful career. They seek honest guidance, a supportive community, and the tools to navigate the challenges of the music world, transforming their raw passion into sustainable success.[c]



            Session 2: SB2 - Has a Problem

            The information below is a summary of the responses to the survey questions sent to collect information regarding the “Villain” and the different types of problems.

            The Villain

            We started by asking these questions in the survey: Is there a root cause for your client's problems? Can you personify this root cause as a villain? What is the villain in your customer's story?


            Based on the responses provided through the survey, here's a summary analysis highlighting the main themes:


            1. Industry Complexity and Gatekeepers:

            Two responses point to the music industry itself as a significant problem. They describe it as complex, intricate, and difficult to break into. The concept of "The Gatekeeper" as the villain is introduced, symbolizing the various barriers and selective nature of the industry.


            2. Lack of Information and Guidance:

            This theme is also prominent. Two responses highlight the absence of clear information on how to make progress in the industry and the lack of proper guidance for aspiring artists.[d]


            3. Multiple Industry Players as Obstacles:

            One of the responses provided a detailed list of potential "villains" within the industry, including radio stations, programmers, record labels, managers, agents, and entertainment industry attorneys. This suggests that various stakeholders in the industry can act as obstacles for aspiring artists. [e]


            4. Internal Challenges:

            Another response also touches on internal challenges faced by artists, such as naivety, subjective perceptions, fragile sense of security, wrong expectations, and unrealistic goals.[f]


            5. Limited Access to Resources and Opportunities:

            Two responses mention limited access to resources and lack of opportunities as key problems.


            Main Theme:

            The overarching theme that emerges from these responses is that the music industry itself, with its complexity, gatekeepers, and multiple stakeholders, acts as the primary villain in the customer's story. This industry-wide challenge is compounded by a lack of clear guidance and information for aspiring artists, creating a formidable barrier to entry and success.


            This villain manifests both externally (through industry structures and gatekeepers) and internally (through the artist's own misconceptions and lack of information), making it a multifaceted challenge that requires a comprehensive solution.

            External Problems:

            We went deeper into the external problems by asking ourselves: What is an external problem your customers deal with as it relates to your product or service?


            Based on these responses, here's a summary analysis of the external problems that customers face, according to the StoryBrand framework:


            1. Lack of Visibility and Access:

            The first and third responses highlight this as a major external problem. Artists struggle to gain visibility in a crowded industry and have difficulty accessing the necessary resources, tools, and networks to advance their careers.


            2. Gatekeeping and Rejection:

            The first response explicitly mentions rejection and neglect from music labels and industry professionals who control access to significant opportunities. This creates a tangible external barrier for artists trying to break into the industry.[g][h]


            3. Lack of Control Over Career:

            The second response touches on the issue of artists feeling powerless in their own careers, with decisions often made by third parties. This suggests an external problem of not having agency or control over one's own artistic journey.


            4. Industry Oversaturation:

            The fourth response, "Too much noise," alludes to the overcrowded nature of the music industry. This creates an external problem of standing out and being heard amidst a sea of other artists and content.[i][j][k]


            5. Difficulty in Getting Creations Heard:

            The third response directly states this as an external problem. Artists struggle to find platforms or opportunities to showcase their work to a wider audience.


            6. Dealing with Failure:

            The second response mentions artists taking failure personally, suggesting an external problem of not having proper support systems or mechanisms to deal with setbacks in the industry.[l][m]


            Main Theme that Emerges:

            The overarching external problem is the difficulty in navigating and succeeding in a complex, oversaturated, and often exclusionary music industry. Artists face tangible barriers in terms of access, visibility, and control over their careers, while also struggling to stand out in a noisy marketplace.


            This external problem aligns well with the StoryBrand framework, as it presents a clear, tangible challenge that the product or service (in this case, INCURATOR) can help solve. It sets the stage for INCURATOR to position itself as the guide that can help artists overcome these external barriers and navigate the complexities of the music industry.

            Internal Problems:

            We went deeper into the internal problems by asking ourselves: How is the villain making your customers feel? (Internal Problem)


            Based on these responses, here's a summary analysis of the internal problems (feelings) that customers experience, according to the StoryBrand framework:


            1. Feelings of Inadequacy and Inferiority:

            Multiple responses touch on this theme. Artists feel "unimportant, undeveloped, inferior" and experience "doubt of their own talents." This suggests a significant internal struggle with self-worth and confidence in their abilities.


            2. Powerlessness and Lack of Control:[n]

            The first response explicitly mentions feeling "powerless," while the second response implies a loss of control when artists realize they "have to fight in the long run" instead of becoming instant stars.


            3. Isolation and Disconnection:

            The first response mentions artists feeling "isolated," suggesting a sense of being alone in their struggles and disconnected from the industry they aspire to join.


            4. Frustration and Disappointment:[o]

            Several responses allude to feelings of frustration. Artists experience their "dreams slipping away" and feel "rejected," indicating a sense of disappointment and unfulfilled aspirations.


            5. Fear and Insecurity:

            The fourth response directly mentions artists feeling "scared," while the second response talks about the villains hitting "their sense of security." This points to a pervasive feeling of fear and insecurity in navigating the music industry.


            6. Confusion:

            The fourth response explicitly states that artists feel "confused," suggesting a lack of clarity about how to proceed in their careers or navigate the industry.[p]


            7. Wounded Pride:

            The second response mentions that the villains hit the artists "directly in their pride," indicating feelings of humiliation or damaged self-esteem.


            8. Feeling Lost or Stuck:

            The first response describes artists feeling "lost/stuck," suggesting a sense of being trapped or unable to progress in their careers.


            Main Theme that Emerges:

            The overarching internal problem is a deep-seated feeling of inadequacy[q], powerlessness, and confusion in the face of a challenging and often rejecting music industry. Artists are struggling not just with external barriers, but with significant emotional and psychological challenges that impact their self-worth, confidence, and ability to persist in pursuing their dreams.


            This aligns well with the StoryBrand framework, as it clearly articulates the emotional stakes for the customer. By identifying these internal problems, INCURATOR can position itself as a solution that not only addresses practical challenges but also helps artists overcome these powerful negative emotions, restoring their confidence, sense of control, and clarity in their artistic journey.


            Philosophical Problems:[r]
            We went deeper into the philosophical problems by asking ourselves: Why is it "just plain wrong" for your customers to be burdened by this villain? (Philosophical Problem)


            Based on the responses, here's a summary analysis of the Philosophical Problems that customers experience:


            It is fundamentally unjust for artists to be blocked by gatekeepers and systemic obstacles when talent and hard work should be the true measures of success. Every artist deserves a fair chance and access to platforms that can help them succeed, as everyone deserves an opportunity to prove their worth.


            This combined statement captures the essence of the philosophical problem, emphasizing fairness, opportunity, and the rightful recognition of talent and hard work.


            Summary of Session 2

            Based on the transcript of the second session, here's a summary of the key points discussed, areas of alignment, and areas of potential disagreement:


            1. Summary of key points:


            Villain:

            - The "middle person" or middleman in the music industry

            - Can be record labels, managers, lawyers, family members, etc.

            - Gatekeepers and stakeholders in the music industry


            External Problem:

            - Gatekeeping

            - Lack of proper guidance and opportunity (a detailed summary of guidance and opportunity provided below)

            - Industry oversaturation and noise (a detailed summary of each provided below)

            - Difficulty in gaining visibility and access

            - Competition for listener attention (listener oversaturation)

            - Short-term focus of record labels[s][t]


            Internal Problem: [u][v][w]

            - Feelings of despair, powerlessness, and isolation

            - Feeling rejected (feeling of rejection by being ignored)

            - Self-doubt and lack of confidence

            - Fear , sadness and insecurity

            - Frustration and confusion


            Philosophical Problem:

            - Lack of fair chance for artists to prove their worth

            - Talent and hard work should dictate success, not access to gatekeepers

            - Lack of opportunities to get proper guidance and tools to be heard

            - The industry's focus on short-term gains rather than long-term artist development

            - From the Character perspective: Not having a personal philosophy of not taking NO for an answer (Resilience) (also an internal problem)[x][y][z]


            2. Points with greatest alignment:


            - The concept of the "middle person" as the villain

            - Industry oversaturation as a significant external problem

            - The short-term focus of record labels as a key issue (that can be an opportunity)

            - The need for proper guidance and opportunities for artists

            - The internal struggle artists face, including feelings of despair and self-doubt


            3. Points with least alignment:


            - Whether the industry's practices are truly "unjust" or simply the nature of the business

            - The extent to which lack of talent plays a role in an artist's failure (discussed by Franco and Gabriel)

            - How INCURATOR should not focus on "purifying" music taste, but simply help artists achieve their goals even if their music is not of the highest quality (discussed by Gabriel)

            - The exact definition of what is a “philosophical problem”, and how defining these types of problems could be relevant to INCURATOR, with Jorge discussing how words like “unjust” might not apply in the definition of these problems.


            Overall, there was general agreement on the main issues facing artists in the music industry, but some nuanced differences in how participants viewed the root causes and potential approaches. The discussion revealed a tension between accepting the harsh realities of the industry as is and identifying INCURATOR’s position and messaging regarding these hard realities and ways it can provide value to artists navigating them. The full cleaned up transcript is available for review in the google drive.


            Based on the transcript, here's a detailed summary of the definitions for "oversaturation" and "noise" mentioned in the document:


            Below we provide detailed descriptions of two forms of external problems, “oversaturation” and “noise”


            Oversaturation:


            1. Volume of music releases:

            - Diego mentions that on a daily basis, there are 100,000 different tracks being released on Spotify.

            - In the Latin music industry alone, about 5,000 different tracks come from trusted sources in a week.


            2. Oversaturation of industry players:

            - There's an oversaturation of characters trying to take advantage of artists.

            - Many new managers are trying to get in as early as possible with artists, hoping to find the next big star (like Bad Bunny).


            3. Saturation in business aspects:

            - Gabriel points out that there's saturation in budgets.

            - Labels are oversaturated with what they can sign.

            - Radio is saturated because they can only play a limited number of songs (around 40).


            4. Consumer attention:

            - Diego and Javier discuss the oversaturation from the consumer side.

            - There's an attention limit for listeners, making it difficult for them to keep up with all new releases.


            Noise:


            1. Jorge's definition:

            - Too many opinions and views in the industry.

            - An excess of advice: "too many this is what you need to do, that's what you need to do."

            - This abundance of often conflicting information is very distracting and confusing for artists.


            2. Information overload:

            - While not explicitly called "noise," the discussion touches on the difficulty for consumers to navigate the vast amount of new music.

            - This leads to reliance on third-party curation and algorithms (like Spotify's Discover Weekly) to filter through the "noise" of available music.


            3. Market complexity:

            - The evolving market, controlled by the Internet, has created a complex environment that the industry is struggling to navigate.

            - This complexity could be seen as a form of "noise" that makes it difficult for artists and industry professionals to clearly see paths to success.


            In summary, "oversaturation" primarily refers to the sheer volume of music, artists, and industry players in the market, while "noise" relates more to the overwhelming amount of information, opinions, and options that can confuse and distract both artists and consumers in the music industry.


            Guidance and Opportunity:


            Based on the transcript, here's a summary of what was discussed regarding the need to provide proper guidance and opportunity:


            1. External Problem Identification:

            Diego summarized two main external problems: lack of proper guidance and lack of opportunity. These were seen as overarching issues that encompass other problems like lack of visibility, access, and issues with gatekeeping and rejection.


            2. Complexity of the Industry:

            The participants acknowledged that the music business is complex and oversaturated. This complexity makes it difficult for artists to navigate without proper guidance.


            3. Changing Consumer Behavior:

            Diego pointed out that consumer behavior has changed significantly over the past decades. This change creates both threats and opportunities, emphasizing the need for guidance to help artists adapt to these new realities.


            4. Attention Economy:

            The discussion touched on the challenge of gaining listener attention in an oversaturated market. Proper guidance could help artists navigate this "attention economy" more effectively.


            5. Alternative Paths to Success:

            Gabriel mentioned that there are unlimited opportunities outside the traditional industry structure, but most people don't know how to approach them. This highlights the need for guidance to explore these alternative paths.


            6. Defining Success:

            The participants noted that many artists lack clear goals or have unrealistic expectations of success. Proper guidance could help artists define what success means for them and how to achieve it.


            7. Long-term Development:

            Franco and Diego criticized the industry's focus on short-term gains and viral hits. They suggested that proper guidance could help artists focus on long-term development and sustainability.


            8. Philosophical Perspective:

            Diego explicitly stated that what's fundamentally wrong is artists not having the opportunity to get proper guidance to be heard. He emphasized that receiving proper guidance and opportunity can lead to artists being heard by more people.


            9. Tools and Resources:

            Diego also mentioned that artists need proper tools in addition to guidance, suggesting that opportunity involves providing resources as well as advice.


            10. INCURATOR's Role:

            The discussion implied that INCURATOR could position itself as a provider of this much-needed guidance and opportunity, helping artists navigate the complex industry landscape with the correct guidance and tools to help find alternative paths to success.


            In summary, the need for proper guidance and opportunity was seen as a crucial factor in addressing the external problems faced by artists in the music industry. It was viewed as a way to help artists navigate complexity, adapt to changes, define their goals, and find sustainable paths to success in a challenging and oversaturated market.




            Session 3: Ranking of Problems




            Based on the transcript of the third session, here's a summary and analysis:


            1. Key points discussed:


            - Ranking of various problems faced by artists in the music industry on two axes: market size and pain/urgency

            - Discussion of industry complexity, lack of guidance, lack of opportunities, oversaturation, and various emotional challenges faced by artists

            - Debate on the nature of talent and resilience in artists

            - Consideration of INCURATOR's target audience and how to approach different types of artists


            2. Points with greatest alignment:


            - Industry complexity is a significant issue but not one INCURATOR can directly solve

            - Lack of opportunities is a high-pain, large-market problem

            - Lack of proper guidance is a large-market issue but with low perceived urgency for artists

            - Emotional challenges (feeling powerless, confused, ignored) are interconnected and represent a significant problem

            - INCURATOR should focus on helping artists find their path in the industry, even if they lack traditional talent


            3. Points with least alignment:


            - The placement of "artists with lack of talent" on the problem matrix

            - The extent to which resilience can be developed or taught

            - Whether INCURATOR should focus on established artists or newcomers


            4. Short statement ranking the problems:


            Based on the discussion, the problems can be ranked as follows in terms of largest market and highest pain/urgency:


            1. Lack of opportunities to be heard (high pain, large market)

            2. Industry complexity (large market, but not directly addressable)

            3. Emotional challenges (feeling powerless, confused, ignored) (high pain, significant market)

            4. Lack of proper guidance (large market, but low perceived urgency)

            5. Competition for listener attention (moderate market and pain)

            6. Oversaturation (large market, but low urgency)

            7. Lack of resilience (small market, low perceived urgency)

            8. Artists with lack of talent (small market, low urgency, debated relevance)


            This ranking suggests that INCURATOR should primarily focus on providing opportunities for artists to be heard, while also addressing the emotional challenges they face and offering guidance to navigate the complex music industry landscape.


            Session 4: SB3 - And meets a guide
            The information below is a summary of the responses to the survey questions sent to collect information regarding the “Guide” (Incurator) that the Character meets.


            There are two dimensions to be defined about the Guide:


            An Empathetic Statement
            A Statement to generate Credibility

            Regarding Empathy, the question asked in the survey is the following:


            What empathetic statements can you make so your customers know you care about their internal problem?


            The main theme that emerges from these responses is one of empathy, support, and resilience in the face of music industry challenges. Here's a brief summary statement:


            "We understand[aa] the frustration and disappointment of facing seemingly insurmountable barriers in the music industry. You're not alone in this journey. While the path may be difficult, there are always new opportunities and second chances. With the right support and guidance, you can overcome these challenges, grow, and find your place in the music world, whether as a performer or in another capacity. We're here to stand by your side, offering friendship, understanding, and the tools you need to take control of your musical career and pursue your dreams."[ab][ac]


            This statement encapsulates the shared themes of empathy for the artists' struggles, the promise of support and community, the emphasis on resilience and perseverance, and the suggestion that there are multiple paths to success in the music industry.
















            Regarding credibility, the question asked in the survey is the following:


            In what ways can you demonstrate competence and authority in solving your customer's problems? Explore potential testimonials, statistics that demonstrate competence, awards you won, or  other businesses you helped succeed. Don't be humble.


            The main theme emerging from these responses is the emphasis on extensive industry experience, expertise, and credibility. Here's a brief summary statement:


            "Incurator's strength lies in its leadership team's collective century-plus of experience in the music industry, spanning artist management, production, finance, marketing, technology, and entertainment law. This wealth of knowledge is complemented by positive feedback from beta users and a network of respected industry connections. Our team's diverse expertise allows us to understand the complex challenges artists face and provide innovative, comprehensive solutions. [ad]By combining seasoned industry insight with cutting-edge technology and user-driven development, Incurator is uniquely positioned to guide artists through the ever-evolving music landscape, helping them navigate challenges and seize opportunities for success."[ae]


            This statement encapsulates the key points of competence and authority:


            1. Extensive leadership experience across various aspects of the music industry

            2. Positive feedback and collaboration with beta users

            3. A strong network of industry contacts and respected advisors

            4. A commitment to continuous improvement based on user feedback

            5. The ability to leverage industry knowledge to create innovative solutions

            6. A track record of witnessing and understanding industry challenges

            7. A combination of industry expertise and technological innovation


            These elements collectively demonstrate Incurator's capability to serve as a competent and authoritative guide for artists in the music industry.


            Summary of Session 4:

            Based on the transcript of the fourth session, here's the summary and analysis:


            1. Key points discussed:

            - The importance of balancing empathy and authority in positioning INCURATOR

            - The need for concise and impactful messaging

            - The challenge of establishing credibility in the music industry

            - The potential use of AI and technology as a differentiator for INCURATOR

            - The concept of INCURATOR as an alternative path through the chaos of the music industry

            - The importance of setting proper expectations for clients

            - The potential of using AI to create personalized mentorship experiences


            2. Points with greatest alignment:

            - The need for more concise messaging in both empathy and authority statements

            - The importance of demonstrating both industry experience and technological innovation

            - The value of setting realistic expectations for clients

            - The potential of AI as a differentiating factor for INCURATOR


            3. Points that remain unclear:

            Session 7: SB5 - And calls them to action

            First: Key points discussed:

            1. Direct and transitional calls to action:

            The team discussed the difference between direct calls to action (like "register" and "buy") and transitional calls to action. They explored how the AI-powered chat sequence could serve as a series of transitional calls to action, guiding users through the onboarding process. The group also considered how these transitional steps could lead to a conversion event, such as a live online session with Incurator team members.


            2. Onboarding process and not calling it a trial:

            The team proposed avoiding the term "30-day trial" to create a sense of immediate inclusion for users. They discussed making the onboarding process more dynamic and personalized based on the artist's experience level. The group also debated the ideal length of the onboarding process, considering the balance between gathering comprehensive information and maintaining user interest.


            3. Conversion event and live sessions:

            The team emphasized the importance of a live conversion event to create credibility and enthusiasm among potential paying members.

            2. The value of live conversion events:

            There was strong agreement on the importance of live events for converting users into paying members. The team recognized that these events could create a sense of community and showcase the value of Incurator's offerings.

            1. The use of the word "chaos" in the one-liner:

            There was some disagreement about using the word "chaos" to describe the music industry. Franco expressed concern about using a negative word in their messaging, while Gabriel and Javier felt it was powerful and relatable. They debated whether the term might alienate potential industry partners or if it would resonate with artists feeling overwhelmed by the industry.


            2. The number of participants for the beta launch:

            The team had differing opinions on the ideal number of beta testers. Gabriel suggested a larger group of up to 100 or more for statistical significance, while Franco preferred a smaller group of 5-10 for more focused feedback. They discussed the trade-offs between quantity of feedback and the ability to manage and implement changes based on that feedback.


            3. The use of Gabriel's connections for beta testing:

            There was some uncertainty about using Gabriel's connections from the Latin Grammy Cultural Foundation for beta testing.

            3. Onboarding process and user engagement:

            6. Oversaturation in the music market:

            The group debated the issue of market oversaturation, ultimately concluding that the problem is not oversaturation itself, but rather an abundance of low-quality content.


            Second: Points with greatest alignment:

            1. The need for personalized goal-setting:

            All participants agreed that helping artists define their own goals is crucial. They recognized that success looks different for each artist and that INCURATOR should facilitate this self-discovery.


            2. The value of industry experience in guiding artists:

            There was strong agreement that INCURATOR's collective industry knowledge is a key asset. Participants believed this could help artists avoid common pitfalls and make better decisions.

            All participants recognized the need for an engaging, low-friction onboarding process. They agreed that this process should be flexible and provide value to the artist from the start.[bc]


            Third: Points with least alignment:

            1. The extent of market oversaturation:

            There was some disagreement about whether the music market is truly oversaturated. Some viewed it as a problem of too much content, while others argued it's more about a lack of quality content.


            2. The definition of relevance for artists:

            While all agreed relevance is important, there were differing views on what constitutes relevance for different types of artists.

            Other comments from Enrique and Gabriel:
            Key comments that were extracted from the transcript about key concepts what we have shared in previous Sessions where Enrique’s and Gabriel’s interventions were noted:


            Here are the statements from Enrique and Gabriel on the requested subjects:


            1. Success (Enrique):

            "Success is subjective and can vary greatly. Failure can be not selling $100 million in tickets, but having a tour of $40 million. These are just levels of success, but the real issue is relevance."


            2. Relevance (Enrique):

            "Relevance encompasses everything. If you're irrelevant in whatever you're doing, then you fail. Especially in the artistic side, relevance is the key driver. If your voice is not heard, by any measure of success you want to use, then you don't exist in this space. Our job is to try to make them relevant and provide them with those tools."


            3. Saturation (Enrique):

            "I differ on the idea of oversaturation. Because of the tools and everything happening right now, we have a massive consumption of music that we've never had before. People are requesting to be saturated because they're asking for more and more. The problem isn't oversaturation; it's that there's not that much quality. If everything was quality, there would be demand for consumption. The problem is the oversaturation of bad content. That's where Incurator can help to create good content that is more relevant than the bad content that is becoming irrelevant."


            Gabriel's idea after Enrique's intervention on saturation:

            "One of the things we shouldn't forget is that among those money makers could be the creation of a top 10 list produced by the serious curators of Incurator. We can watch, listen to, and analyze music that no one knows. With a very serious list, we can become the source of new creative offers for the public that is curious about new music. If we can produce something with a great level of quality, we can suddenly become the point of reference for good things."

            1. The final step of the Storybrand framework: "End in a Success" or creating a happy ending for the artist's journey.

            Other relevant comments shared:

            Enrique and Diego discussed distribution deals in the music industry. Here's a summary of their key points:


            1. Enrique mentioned that the industry is shifting from standard recording deals to distribution deals.


            2. He noted that some big companies have separate distribution entities from their traditional labels.


            3. Enrique specifically mentioned Sony Latin and The Orchard as an example, stating that The Orchard is generating about a third of Sony's recording industry revenues, but at a tenth of the operational cost.


            4. Diego agreed with Enrique's points and expanded on them:


            - He confirmed that distribution entities like ADA (which he works for) operate with smaller teams and lower costs compared to traditional labels.



            - He mentioned that Warner Latin has 60 people in Miami, while ADA has a team of 25 people across Latin America.



            - Diego noted that 55% of Warner Latin's revenue comes from distribution deals they had before ADA came into the picture.


            5. Both discussed how traditional labels are struggling to adapt to this new model:


            - Labels are providing extra services, sometimes at a cost to themselves, because they have teams set up for tasks that distributors are already doing more efficiently.



            - There's often competition between the traditional label side and the distribution side within the same company (e.g., Sony and The Orchard).


            6. Enrique suggested that if he were running Sony, he would consider spinning off The Orchard as a standalone company, as it would likely get a higher valuation than as part of Sony.


            7. They both agreed that distributors are becoming increasingly important and may look to companies like Incurator to handle A&R functions that they're not equipped to do themselves.


            This discussion highlights the changing dynamics in the music industry, with distribution becoming a more crucial and potentially more profitable aspect of the business compared to traditional label structures.


            On another topic, Gabriel mentioned a historical approach to discovering talent and suggested a modern adaptation for Incurator. Here's a summary of his comments:


            1. Gabriel referenced "La Hora del Aficionado" (The Amateur's Hour), a radio show from when his parents were young. "La Media Hora del Aficionado" (The Amateur's Half Hour) as it was only 30 minutes long.


            2. The show allowed amateur performers to showcase their talents live on the radio. Performers would introduce themselves, mention where they were from, and what type of music they liked to sing.


            3. He gave an example of how Celia Cruz might have been discovered on such a show, illustrating how unknown talents could gain exposure.


            4. The show evolved from just having performers in the radio cabin to including a live studio audience, allowing for immediate public reaction to the performances.


            5. Gabriel suggested that Incurator could create a similar event or platform to discover talent. He emphasized that this wouldn't be a competition or awards show, but rather an opportunity for artists to be heard and noticed.


            6. He contrasted this idea with Don Francisco's "El Chacal" segment, where performers were interrupted mid-song if they weren't good. Gabriel stressed that Incurator's approach should be more respectful to the artists.


            7. Gabriel saw this as a potential way for Incurator to start generating cash revenue quickly, by organizing events or platforms for talent discovery.


            8. He emphasized that this approach would be about giving opportunities to artists rather than competing or giving awards, focusing on respect for the artists and their talents.


            This suggestion aims to combine traditional talent discovery methods with modern platforms, potentially creating unique opportunities for both Incurator and emerging artists.

            Funding Requirements
            Incurator is seeking an initial investment of $8 million in seed funding to cover the projected deficit and support the company’s growth plans over the next three years. The funds will be allocated toward software development, marketing, talent recruitment, brand building, content production and acquisition, and operational expenses.

            Future funding rounds may be necessary to support expansion into new markets and the development of additional features and services.
            Exit Strategy
            Incurator's exit strategy positions the company as an attractive acquisition target for major music labels, entertainment firms, tech companies, or interested investors. By showcasing our platform's ability to discover, develop, and promote successful artists, we aim to generate substantial value for potential acquirers and transform into a profit center by the third year.

            Additionally, the company will explore the possibility of an IPO or the development of a franchise model to further expand our reach and impact.
